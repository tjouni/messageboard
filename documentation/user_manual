# Instructions for basic usage

## General user

### Registration

When not loggedin as any user, click the Register link at the top of the page. Insert a unique user name, password (twice), full name and a valid e-mail address. Click submit.

### Logging in and out

Log in using registered username and password.

Log out using the link at the top right corner of every page.

### Threads and messages

Threads you have permission to read can be found on the Thread listing page, new threads are created via Create thread link. Every thread needs a title and a message. You will also be able to select a thread category for a thread. Only users in this category will be able to read the thread and post replies.

Replying to a thread is done on the page of the thread. At the bottom of the page is a field for the message and a button to submit reply. Replies are added to the end of the thread.

User is able to edit and delete their own messages in thread view. If you delete the post that started the thread, the whole thread and posts in it are deleted.

### User management

Behind the link User is a listing of all users and their information. Also the number of started threads and posted messages is listed. From this view you can modify and delete your own user account.


## Administrator

Users with admin role are able to delete or modify any message they can view (e.g. have correct category for).

Admins can also view category and role management views, where category and role info is listed. Through these views adding, modifying and deleting categories and roles is possible. Beware that deleting a category deletes ALL threads in that category. Default category and admin role are not deletable.

Admins can modify and delete any user. Admin user modification options include role/category management for each individual user.

Adding new categories to user accounts enables them to create and view threads in that category. Adding roles is also possible, but only the admin role has programmed functionality in the application at this time.
